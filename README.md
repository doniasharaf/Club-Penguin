# Club-Penguin

This is a small Unity card-matching project built using the **MVC (Model–View–Controller)** pattern.  
Cards are fully data-driven using ScriptableObjects, and the game includes two data persistence methods: PlayerPrefs and a Persistence System, currently limited to writing and loading from JSON files in the application's persistent data path.

**How to run:**

1. Open the project in Unity 2021.3.45f1
2. Set up your card data in the provided `CardsData` asset.
3. Hit Play in the editor, or build to Windows/Android and try it out.
